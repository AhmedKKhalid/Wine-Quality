# Model Building 
  * First, Split The Quality to Good or Bad .
  * Second I split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%. 
  * Third I used GridSearchCv to optain the best model.
  * Finally I evaluate my model. 
 
 * I found that Random Forest return the best score 
 
 # Model performance 
  * Random Forest : score = 0.834375
